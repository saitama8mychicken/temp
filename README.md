Suppose I give you a list of keywords - 5 or 10 or maybe even 100 long. The app input is the corpus file and the keyword list. Your task
would be to go into the corpus, sentence-tokenize it and fish out sentences that contain any of the keywords in the list. Collate all
these keyword-matched sentences into a new 'keyword-filtered' corpus as your first output. Display the relative frequencies of the
occurrence of the keywords in your corpus as a bar-chart and as a wordcloud (in separate output tabs) as your second output.
Here is a sample keyword list to test and try on your automotive corpus:
keyword_list = c('engine', 'mileage', 'comfort', 'performance', 'interior', 'maintenance', 'price')
